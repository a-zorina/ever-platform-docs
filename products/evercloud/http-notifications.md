# HTTP notifications

If your goal is to implement business logic that depends on reliable notifications about on-chain events (payments, for example) , then HTTP Notifications can help you with that!&#x20;

You can either use existing Evernode Cloud HTTP Notification Cloud providers or integrate your own. Check the documentation to understand the architecture and decide which way is best for you.&#x20;
