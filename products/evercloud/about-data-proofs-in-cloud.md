# About data proofs in Cloud

Blockchain is a trustless environment and in order to use any blockchain cloud prodiver there should be a mechanism to proof the data it serves.

Our public endpoints have all the data to calculate proofs, meanwhile client libraries have functions with those proofs calculation.&#x20;

At the moment it is possible to prove:

* `block`
* `transaction`
* `message`

Account proof is planned for 2022 year.

Find out more about proof algorithms in SDK documentation.
