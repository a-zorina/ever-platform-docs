# Dedicated node

While EverCloud works on shared nodes, `Dedicated` option provides you with your dedicated nodes and APIs, maintained by Evernode Platform Team.

This enables paying only for CPU/Storage instead of number of requests and configuring databases for particular use-cases to provide the best performance.
